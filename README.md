# PixelOverlay

**PixelOverlay** â€“ a lightweight tool to display a semi-transparent image overlay on your screen. It allows you to:

- Place any `.jpg` or `.png` image over your workspace.  
- Adjust the **opacity** with a slider in a side control panel.  
- Move and **scale** the overlay image to fit your needs.  
- Save and load **configurations** (position, scale, opacity) with automatic numbering.  
- Keep the overlay **click-through**, so you can draw or interact with applications underneath.  

Ideal for digital artists, designers, or anyone who wants to **trace or reference images directly on their screen** without interfering with other apps.
